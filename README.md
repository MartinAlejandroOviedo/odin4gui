# odin4gui
Native Linux GUI for the odin4 Samsung flashing tool


## How does it work?

The executable provided in this repository is the result of combining Python code with the Odin4 executable; I only created the interface, as it's more user-friendly than a pure terminal.


## How to use it?

It's quite simple to use, it's just like the original Odin for Windows; you can place the AP, BL, CSC, etc. files in the corresponding fields and start the flashing process normally.
