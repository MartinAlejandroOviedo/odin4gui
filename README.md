## How does it work?

The executable provided in this repository is the result of combining Python code with the Odin4 executable; I only created the interface, as it's more user-friendly than a pure terminal.


## How to use it?

It's quite simple to use, it's just like the original Odin for Windows; you can place the AP, BL, CSC, etc. files in the corresponding fields and start the flashing process normally.


## How to do it?

First, go to the Releases tab and download the latest executable "odin4gui" and run it directly by right-clicking and choosing run, It might be necessary to grant execution permission first.

Another way to run it is by granting permission in the terminal and executing with `sudo`.
